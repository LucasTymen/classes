###################### Static Methods ######################

Within a JavaScript class, the static keyword defines a static method for a
class. Static methods are not called on individual instances of the class,
but are called on the class itself. Therefore, they tend to be general
(utility) methods.

/*
######################### Class #########################
JavaScript supports the concept of classes as a syntax for creating objects.
Classes specify the shared properties and methods that objects produced from
the class will have.

When an object is created based on the class, the new object is referred to as
an instance of the class. New instances are created using the new keyword.

The code sample shows a class that represents a Song. A new object called
mySong is created underneath and the .play() method on the class is called.
The result would be the text Song playing! printed in the console.
*/

  constructor() {
    this.title;
    this.author;
  }

  play() {
    console.log('Song playing!');
  }
}

const mySong = new Song();
mySong.play();


/*
###################### Class Constructor ######################
Classes can have a constructor method. This is a special method that is called
when the object is created (instantiated). Constructor methods are usually used
to set initial values for the object.
*/
class Song2 {
  constructor(title2, artist2) {
    this.title2 = title2;
    this.artist2 = artist2;
  }
}

const mySong2 = new Song2('Bohemian Rhapsody', 'Queen');
console.log(mySong2.title2);
/*
###################### Class Methods ######################
Properties in objects are separated using commas. This is not the case when
using the class syntax. Methods in classes do not have any separators between
them.
*/
class Song {
  play() {
    console.log('Playing!');
  }

  stop() {
    console.log('Stopping!');
  }

/*
######################### extends #########################
JavaScript classes support the concept of inheritance â€” a child class can
extend a parent class. This is accomplished by using the extends keyword as
part of the class definition.

Child classes have access to all of the instance properties and methods of the
parent class. They can add their own properties and methods in addition to
those. A child class constructor calls the parent class constructor using the
super() method.

*/
// Parent class
class Media {
  constructor(info) {
    this.publishDate = info.publishDate;
    this.name = info.name;
  }
}

// Child class
class Song3 extends Media {
  constructor(songData) {
    super(songData);
    this.artist = songData.artist;
  }
}

const mySong3 = new Song3({
  artist: 'Queen',
  name: 'Bohemian Rhapsody',
  publishDate: 1975
});
